This questionnaire will be used to collect answers detailing the statistical approach that your research team has taken. Your answers will then be used to facilitate the round-robin peer review process.

Please provide enough information for a naive empiricist to be able to give you valuable feedback. Remember, not all individuals involved in this project come from the same discipline, so some methods might be unfamiliar/have a different name to those in other areas. 

There are two sections: one that will be shared with other researchers, and one that we will use internally to get a good first idea about actual results. Only the analytic methods will be shared with the crowdsourcing groups to avoid bias.
